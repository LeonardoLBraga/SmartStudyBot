    Displays a multiple-choice quiz to the user based on the given subject.

    The function attempts to load a list of questions from a JSON file located
    at 'data/questions/{subject}.json' using UTF-8 encoding. If the file is found,
    it selects the first 5 questions after shuffling and presents them one by one
